# A machine problem that requires List Implementation using Clojure

## What is Clojure
>Clojure is a dynamic, general-purpose programming language, combining the approachability and interactive development of a scripting language with an efficient and robust infrastructure for multithreaded programming. Clojure is a compiled language, yet remains completely dynamic â€“ every feature supported by Clojure is supported at runtime. Clojure provides easy access to the Java frameworks, with optional type hints and type inference, to ensure that calls to Java can avoid reflection.

### Lists in Clojure
>Lists are sequential linked lists that add new elements at the head of the list, instead of at the tail like vectors.
>Lists are not indexed so they must be walked using first and rest.

### Constructing Lists in Clojure
>Because lists are evaluated by invoking the first element as a function, we must quote a list to prevent evaluation:

- ## **Retrieve first element of a list**
